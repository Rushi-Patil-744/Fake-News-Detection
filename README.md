<h1>Fake News Detection Project</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project aims to create a model that can classify news articles as <strong>"Real News"</strong> or <strong>"Fake News"</strong> based on their content. This is a relevant and trending topic, as misinformation continues to be a significant issue in today's information landscape.</p>

<h2>What We Did</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Problem Statement:</strong>
        <p>We aimed to create a model that can classify news articles as "Real News" or "Fake News" based on their content.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Data Creation:</strong>
        <p>We generated a synthetic dataset for training and testing our model, which includes various articles labeled as either "Real" or "Fake."</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Converted the text to lowercase.</li>
            <li>Removed punctuation and special characters.</li>
            <li>Tokenized the text into words.</li>
            <li>Vectorized the text data using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Model Selection:</strong>
        <p>We used a machine learning model (like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest) to classify the articles.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Model Training:</strong>
        <p>Trained the selected model on our preprocessed training dataset to learn patterns associated with real and fake news.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Model Evaluation:</strong>
        <p>Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy as a metric by testing it on a separate test set.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Gradio Interface Creation:</strong>
        <p>Built an interactive user interface using Gradio that allows users to input text (news articles) and receive predictions on whether the input text is classified as "Real News" or "Fake News."</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Testing the Interface:</strong>
        <p>Tested the Gradio interface by entering various news headlines to verify the functionality and accuracy of the model.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The project effectively combines data generation, preprocessing, machine learning model training, evaluation, and user interface development to address the problem of fake news detection. This showcases skills in data science, machine learning, and application development, making it a valuable addition to your resume.</p>
